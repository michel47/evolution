We are acknoledging some profound transformation,
as we are given the tools to collaborate at large...

This website is part of a distributed cloud which has
no central organization nor server for it's delivery.

we have to keep in mind that if we want us to be free
from the control of a few, we need to participate in
a truly peer-to-peer network build for us, and "operate" for us.

In other words this means that we mutualize our "computing" ressources
for serve our community, but running a "node" in the network
as often as possible to share all content that matters to us all.

Open Data and Common Goods are this way rendered available to us all.
